One of the major worries for banks and another lending companies has been the large-scale increase in defaults of unsecured loans and other personal loans. A loan default will result in a loss of both principal and interest. So, the decision-making process in the loan approval process is immense. In today's world, financial information availability of individuals is growing large which represents their behavior and the risks around the loan. Data Science collects these large sets of data to extract meaning from and interpret data using tools and methods from statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we will attempt to detect the expected returns for loans to a given borrower by using different machine learning algorithms. This helps banks to predict whether an individual would be able to repay their loan or not. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the available loan data and predict the likely defaulters to reduce risk.
