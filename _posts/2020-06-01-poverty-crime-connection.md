People living in households in the US that have an income level below the Federal poverty threshold have more than double the rates of violent victimization compared to individuals in high-income households.
 
For both whites and blacks/African-Americans in the US, the overall pattern of being in poverty with the highest rates of victimization was consistent.
 
Urban poverty increased the risks of violence and crime for US households, but did not change the racial risk factors.
