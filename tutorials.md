# Tutorials

This page of my portfolio contains a list of tutorials I have come across that helped me in learning in depth different fields in data science. You will find here lists of books, scientific articles from different disciplines, video lectures, slides, etc. Some of the papers will be more domain specific to software engineering. 

### Databases 

NoSQL MongoDB for Developers 
- https://education.10gen.com/courses


### Data Cleansing 

Jeff Leek Data Mugging 

	https://github.com/jtleek/dataanalysis/blob/master/pdfs/dataMungingBasics.pdf (See the references on the lecture for more in depth discussion)



Papers
    Statistical Distortion: Consequences of Data Cleasing by Tamraparni Dasu and Ji Meng Loh
    	http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1674_tamraparnidasu_vldb2012.pdf

		Metadata

### Visualization  

Alberto Cairo lectures on InfoGraphs and Visualization from University of Miami 
- http://open.journalismcourses.org/enrol/index.php?id=6 (obs course does not allow to enroll currently)
- See the associated youtube pages for the video lectures:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QinBJpjsm6E&list=PLa4VFIBUKrgLao-DalwedOCiq9RV6MPk9
Also look for his website: http://www.thefunctionalart.com/


IVMOOC which ran on January 2012 by Katy Borner on Infographics and Visualization from Indiana University
- http://ivmooc.appspot.com/course 

Surprisingly still allow enrollment although you won't receive certificate. The lectures are available there and were hosted in youtube. 

#Courses 

Data science and related courses.

Berkley data science course by ex facebook data guy (videos seems to be no-go, but slides are still available of both years).

#Books 

Since books cover a wide of subjects, they deserve a section on their own.

Columbia data science lecture notes are pretty interesting. They recently released a book the course, seek for the professor name in Amazon, it is published by O'reilly.

I particularly liked the part about the data cleasing being done with a combination of shell script + python (Cleasing Pipe as they like to call). 

#Miscellaneous 

Other blog post and interesting content I came across.
